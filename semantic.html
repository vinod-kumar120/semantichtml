                MEDAK CHURCH⛪
                <p>Medak Cathedral is one of the most visited churches in South India, which was built by Charles Walker Fasnet of British Wesleyan Methodists and consecrated on 25 December 1924. It is the single largest diocese in Asia and the second-largest in the world after the Vatican located in Medak town.</p>
                <p>Medak Cathedral is the seat of the Bishop in Medak for the Church of South India (comprising Wesleyan Methodist, Congregational and Anglican missionary societies). The church complex is an Architectural Marvel spread in more than 300 acres. The cathedral is 100 ft (30 m) wide and 200 ft (61 m) long, and conforms to the Gothic Revival style and can accommodate about 5,000 people at a time.</p>
                <p>The mosaic tiles were imported from Britain and Italian masons were engaged for laying the decorative flooring. Massive pillars built with fine-hewn and well-dressed grey stone support the gallery and the whole edifice. The roof of the church is made sound-proof by means of hollow sponge material and has an impressive style of vaulting. The bell-tower is 175 ft (53 m) high and visible from few miles.</p>
